Nullable:
1. `MaybeNull` and other attributes, and the relation to unspeakable types. (Chuck)
2. Do we want to have an analysis that can tell when a test against null would have a known result, so we can produce a hidden diagnostic?  [roslyn#29868](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/29868) (Aleksey/Neal)
3. Tracking assignments through refs and ref expressions (e.g. `(q ? ref x : ref y) = null;` or  `(q ? ref x : ref y) = "";`), and the state of a variable to which a ref has been taken.
4. Nullability flow through conditional access when unconstrained generic type parameters are involved. (Aleksey)
5. Should reachability affect nullable analysis? [roslyn#28798](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/28798) [roslyn#30949](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/30949) [roslyn#32047](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32047) (Fred/Chuck/Aleksey)
