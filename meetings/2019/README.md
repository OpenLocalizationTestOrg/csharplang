# Upcoming meetings for 2019

## Schedule ASAP
- Triage [#2152](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/2152): "Allow Obsolete attribute on getters and setters"
- Open issues in default interface methods (https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/406). We currently have open issues around `protected`, `internal`, reabstraction, and `static` fields among others.

## Schedule when convenient

- Discussion of refreshing language spec (Neal)
- Allowing pattern-based `foreach` and `await foreach` to bind to an extension `GetEnumerator`/`GetAsyncEnumerator` and `MoveNext`/`MoveNextAsync` (Julien/Chris)
- Making a `CancellationToken` available in async-iterator method bodies; possibly reserving a keyword (Julien/Stephen) 
- Syntax of positional records/primary constructors (Andy)

## Recurring topics

- *Triage championed features*
- *Triage milestones*
- *Design review*
